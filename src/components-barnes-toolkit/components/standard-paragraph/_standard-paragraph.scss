/***

Standard paragraph
====
* Class name: n/a
* Tags used on: `<div>`

A simple paragraph (or multiple paragraph of contents) - anything that can be
entered via a WYSIWYG editor.

In most cases, a standard paragraph has its main body of content on its right
hand side however this can be swapped around by using a modifier class.

You are probably better looking at the [block](#block) component to get a better
idea at how this component could be modified for different scenarios.
