![Components come in 3 different sizes](/dist/images/toolkit-components.png "Components in 3 different sizes")

Templates are built from multiple components. 

A component could be a full block of content spanning the entire width of the screen like a [hero component](#hero) with a full-bleed image and its call to action OR it might be a [newsletter sign-up form](#newsletter) which itself can sit inside of another component. Yes thatâ€™s right - the newsletter component usually lives in the footer but, in theory, you could put it another place too and it should. just. work.

*Full-width components:*
 
When a component spans the full screen width then it is usually constructed from a `<div class="container">` and maybe a `<div class="m-block">` too. Full-width components usually have one or many other smaller components inside them.

*Usage:*
 
With the components below, you should be able to be copy the HTML code and paste it into your webpage in-between the `<main id="content" tabindex="-1">{components go here}</main>` tags.

In some cases, you may be able to modify them slightly - especially the `m-block` component but in 90% of cases a simple copy and paste job will work.
