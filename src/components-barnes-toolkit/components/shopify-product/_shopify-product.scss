Very similar to the [product component](#product). This has some key differences with
how it displays alternative images compared to that other component; this time
we have _thumbnails_ which when clicked, swap out the larger image.

There are also more options here as a product could come in different sizes
and or colors.

Shopify resizes images automatically so provided product images are at least
460x460 then everything should look great. Try to uplaod images that are square
for optimal appearance.
