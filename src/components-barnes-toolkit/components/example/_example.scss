This component exists for the UI Engineer only.

It allows the engineer to copy and paste the directory it is in
and rename from _example_ to _my-component-name_ and quickly create a new component.

There is a gulp task that uses this. If you do not know what _gulp_ is then
you can safely ignore this component :)
