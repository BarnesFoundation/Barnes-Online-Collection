Media Block
====
* Class name: `m-block--media`
* Tags used on: `<div>`

This is quite a complex component, at its simplest it is just a wrapper
for different media types or a component. Those things can be:
* an `m-card-artwork` component
* a YouTube `<iframe>`
* a Soundcloud `<iframe>`

In theory it could handle iframes from other suppliers but YouTube and Soundcloud
are the ones that have been tested.

There are two types, a media block:
* with a preceding title and introduction followed by an optional post-media summary
* which is just the media item on its own

When the using the media block on its own. It is usually book-ended by the
[standard paragraph component](#standard-paragraph).
