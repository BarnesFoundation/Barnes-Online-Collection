Skip Link
====
* Class name: `a-skip`
* Tags used on: `a`

Okay this is a *really* cool accessibility feature. Most people will never see
this but keyboard users i.e. people who may have motor disabilities and rely
upon their keyboardâ€™s tab key _instead_ of a mouse will see this link display
when they first hit their tab key and it will allow them to skip to content of
the page and avoid having to hit their tab key tens/hundreds of times on each
page view to get past all the menu links.

Because skips links are hidden and only triggered by keyboard they may not
appear in the box below:

  ```
  <a class="a-skip" href="#content">Skip to content</a>
  <a class="a-skip" href="#footer">Skip to footer</a>
  ```

.a-skip {
  background: $color__white;
  color: $color__copy--medium;
  font-family: $sans-serif--loaded;
  left: 50%;
  opacity: 0;
  padding: 5px 10px;
  position: fixed;
  top: 0;

  &:focus:not(.focus-ring) {

  &.focus-ring {
