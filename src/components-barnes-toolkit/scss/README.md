![Base styles](/dist/images/toolkit-base-styles.png "Base styles")

Applied to web interfaces, these base styles are for our HTML tags, such as a form `label`, an `input` or a `button`.

We also have some very small helper classes in this section.

There are also some more abstract elements like color palettes, typography and even more invisible aspects of an interface like accessibility features.
