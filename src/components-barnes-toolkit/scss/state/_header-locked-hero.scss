/**
 * Header locked hero
 * This is the scenario where our page has a hero element flush with the
 * top of the viewport with the header sat on top of it with a higher z-index.
 * We have gone quite specific with the CSS for this unusual case as we have the
 * following scenarios and other scenarios to override from higher up the cascade.
 *
 * Scenario A - Default/Initial page load:
 * The header sits *on top* of the hero and is transparent (see _has-hero.scss)
 *
 * Scenario B: - User is scrolling 'up'
 * The header is _locked_ and needs to have a solid colour background
 * so itâ€™s legible.
