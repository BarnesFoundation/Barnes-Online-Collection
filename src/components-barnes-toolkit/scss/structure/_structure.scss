Structure
=====
Here is the basic structure of each page.

Take this code copy and paste it into a new HTML file.

Then find the component(s) you need and copy and paste them into
the space where it says _COMPONENTS_ in the order you want them to appear.

*Note about assets:*

Make sure all `<link>` and `<script>` tags `href` and `src` attributes point
to the correct path. They are all set to _/dist/images/_ or _/dist/styles/_
but if your assets aren't stored in a directory called _dist_ at the root of
your website then please update these values.

*Note about script tags:*

This toolkit struggles with `<script>` tags in HTML so they have been modified
to use square insitead of angular brackets.

Please swap the 3 instances of `[script src=""][/script]` with
`<script src=""></script>`.

*Finally:*

Apologies for the appearance of the HTML in the _code_ example below. It may be
wise to run this HTML through a [code beautifier](http://www.cleancss.com/html-beautify/)
before pasting it into your HTML file.
