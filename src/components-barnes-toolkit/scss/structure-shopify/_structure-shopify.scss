/***

Structure (Shopify)
=====
Shopify sites have a slightly different structure.
The header and the footer differ.

The class `shopify-html` on the `HTML` tag caters for the Shopify site having a
menu beneath the logo on large screens.

For Shopify sites without that menu add this class `print-shop-html` instead.

*Note*:

This HTML code is not meant to be copied and pasted to have an instant
Shopify theme, it will still need integration work if used in a dynamic site
like Shopify or Craft.
